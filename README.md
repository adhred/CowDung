# Game Rules:

1)The game generates a random 4-digit number that the player needs to guess. 

2)Players enter their guesses as 4-digit numbers.

3)After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of "cow" and "dung" values:

  ->A "cow" represents a correct digit in the correct position.
  
  ->A "dung" represents a correct digit in the wrong position.
  
4)Players use these clues to refine their subsequent guesses.

5)The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or reaches the maximum number of allowed attempts.

6)If the player guesses the correct number, they win the game.

7)If the player exhausts all attempts without guessing the correct number, they lose the game.
